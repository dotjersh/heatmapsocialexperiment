While this was fun, I no longer have the resources to maintain it, thanks for participating :)

# Heat Map Social Experiment
I was on the bus, bored out of my mind, and wondered: If someone was presented with an 8 by 8 grid (no center), what tile would they choose?

I was in class bored another day and was sick of python so I decided to tackle a small backend web project with mySQL and PHP.
